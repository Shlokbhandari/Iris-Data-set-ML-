# Iris Dataset – Machine Learning

This repository contains my machine learning practical work using the Iris dataset.

## Contents
- `iris_training.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook for training a model on Iris data  
- `iris.xlsx`, `iris-train.xlsx`, `iris-test.xlsx` – Dataset files  
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` – Auto-saved notebook checkpoints

## Train–Test Split

The dataset is divided into:
- 80% for training  
- 20% for testing  

This split helps in:
- Training the model on most of the data  
- Testing its performance on unseen data  
- Reducing overfitting and checking generalization

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

## Purpose
This project is for learning and practicing basic machine learning concepts.
